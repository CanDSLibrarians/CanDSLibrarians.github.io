# Canadian DS Librarians

Welcome to the homepage of the informal Canadian Digital Scholarship Librarian Community of Practice. We have created this project to allow [#digitalscholarship](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalscholarship) Librarians across Canada to have a place to share with one another.

## 2023 Another year upon us

The group is getting ready to plan more activities for this year. Please join the slack site listed below or send us an email at canadiandslibs [at] gmail.com.
