# Canadian DS Librarians

Welcome to the homepage of the informal Canadian Digital Scholarship Librarian Community of Practice. We have created this project to allow #digitalscholarhip Librarians across Canada to have a place to share with one another.

## Fall 2021 Meetup
In conjunction with the [Access Conference](https://accessconference.ca/) we held a pre-conference meetup on October 15, 2021.  Presentation material has been [posted](2021_meetup).
