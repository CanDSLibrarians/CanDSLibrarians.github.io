# Canadian DS Librarians

Welcome to the homepage of the informal Canadian Digital Scholarship Librarian Community of Practice. We have created this project to allow [#digitalscholarship](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalscholarship) Librarians across Canada to have a place to share with one another.

## 2023 Events

This year we are having monthly meetups on the last Wednesday of every month as well as our annual unconference on October 20th. 
Stay on top of events by adding our calendar to yours: [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/canadiandslibs%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/canadiandslibs%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics).

### Monthly Meetups 
Monthly meetups are an informal space for the community to gather and discuss topics of interest. Anyone can propose a topic or volunteer to run a topic that has been proposed but has no owner. To view upcoming topics, add one to the brainstorm, or volunteer to run one check out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kamDKIANffxXHeRbn0UsJFEdcfV3rKUMgKTvBYuafYQ/edit?usp=sharing). _Note that we are currently booked up for 2023 but please feel free to sign up for 2024!_

**Upcoming meetups:**
(monthly meetups are always 10am PST/1pm EST)

* July 26th - topic: navigating low capacity / resources
* August 30th - topic: librarian / staff upskilling, making time for it
* September 27th - topic: online harassment, doxxing of researchers, lack of support
