# Canadian DS Librarians

Welcome to the homepage of the informal Canadian Digital Scholarship Librarian Community of Practice. We have created this project to allow [#digitalscholarship](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalscholarship) Librarians across Canada to have a place to share with one another.

## Fall 2022 Meetup

The group will meet on **Friday November 25, from 10am - 1pm PST / 1PM - 4PM EST** 

We are looking for presenters for **Lightning Talks**. Please consider sharing some stories about what you've been working on, or how your organization delivers DS services. We are also looking for topics for **Breakout Discussions**.

### Register
